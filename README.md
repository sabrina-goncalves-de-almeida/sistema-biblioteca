The library system is a library book registration system.

- Register a book;
- Remove a book;
- Search book by title;
- Search a list of overdue books on loan return;
- Search if a book is on loan.

Rename some methods and variables to make them smaller and more readable.
Decrease some classes that are too long, reduce the amount of methods by creating only one book search, as some are just duplicates if the code to do the research is considered.
Comment the interface clearly. Document other methods more concisely so you don't have too long comments in the program logic class.
